    <p> My Name is Albert Wu and am 12 years old. I really like coding and gaming. I really only know Python, HTML and CSS. HTML is like the frame of a house because it displays all of the text, pictures, and more. CSS/Cascading Style Sheets is what styles the HTML document. You can change the color of text, position text/objects, make animations and much more. Javascript/JS is like the vents,  electricity, and the light in a house. Even though Javascript is not necessary in websites, it allows you to create games, calculations and more. I don't really know any Javascript, so most of the Javascript on this website is by tutorials.   </p>
