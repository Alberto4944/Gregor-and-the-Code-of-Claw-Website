    <h1 class="title">About The Book Series</h1>
    <p> <i>Gregor and the Code of Claw</i>
        is a fantasy book and is part of a 5-book series called the Underland Chronicles. They are all by Suzanne Collins, who is the author of the  <i>Hunger Games</i>  series. The main character is Gregor, who is a 12 year old boy and lives in New York City, or the Overland in the series. One day in the first novel, he found his way to their family's laundry room with her sister, Boots, but they fell through a vent and found themselves in the Underland. </p>
        <p> The Underland is like the Overland, but with talking animals. There are humans, bats, mice, cockroaches, spiders, and more that either can or cannot speak. For some animals, they have their own language, like clicks.  </p>
        <p> In the first book, <i> Gregor the Overlander</i>,  Boots, his sister falled through a vent in their family's laundry room and ended up in a place called Regalia because a bat came to pick them up. Regalia is a city with mostly humans, but also includes bats. When they arrived, they both got sent to cleaning rooms (bathrooms with showers, tubs, etc). The entire time, he wanted to get Boots and himself back to the Overland (New York City) and be together again with his family. Later, because Gregor wanted to escape, he went through a "water tunnel" through the tubs in the bathrooms. But, when he found his way to his escape route, a river/waterway he saw when he got taken by the bat, he encoutered two rats and eventually got saved by some Regalians.</p>
        <p> He still wanted to get back to New York City, but Regailians see him as the "Warrior" for some reason. He later learns that there are prophecies (Predictons of what could happen) that include a person named "Warrior", and it has to be someone from the overland. So then he realizes why he is being the one that everyone is talking about. </p>

        
        <p>Because of the "Warrior" now in it's suited place, other animals (mainly the rats) in the underland are mad. The rats are mad, beacuse they wanted to take over the underland.    </p>

        <h1 class="title">About This Book</h1>
        <p> This book, <i>Gregor and the Code of Claw</i>, is about the fifth and final prophecy, The Prophecy of Time. </p>
        <p>It starts off with Gregor getting Sandwich's sword (The sword is very valuable, but come on, he's the warrior) and gets ready to fight. </p>
        
        <p>The reason is, in the last book, <i> Gregor and the Marks of Secret</i>, some mice end up near Regailia and it starts a mission to find the cause and to resolve the issue. So Gregor and a few others including Luxa go travel to places they think there would be a reason to the issue. </p>
