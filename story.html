    <h1 class="title">About The Book Series</h1>
    <p> <i>Gregor and the Code of Claw</i>
        is a fantasy book and is part of a 5-book series called the Underland Chronicles. They are all by Suzanne Collins, who is the author of the  <i>Hunger Games</i>  series. The main character is Gregor, who is a 12 year old boy and lives in New York City, or the Overland in the series. One day in the first novel, he found his way to their family's laundry room with her sister, Boots, but they fell through a vent and found themselves in the Underland. </p>
        <p> The Underland is like the Overland, but with talking animals. There are humans, bats, mice, cockroaches, spiders, and more that either can or cannot speak. For some animals, they have their own language, like clicks.  </p>
        <p> In the first book, <i> Gregor the Overlander</i>,  Boots, his sister fell through a vent in their family's laundry room and ended up in a place called Regalia because a bat came to pick them up. Regalia is a city with mostly humans, but also includes bats. When they arrived, they both got sent to cleaning rooms (bathrooms with showers, tubs, etc). The entire time, he wanted to get Boots and himself back to the Overland (New York City) and be together again with his family. Later, because Gregor wanted to escape, he went through a "water tunnel" through the tubs in the bathrooms. But, when he found his way to his escape route, a river/waterway he saw when he got taken by the bat, he encoutered two rats and eventually got saved by some Regalians.</p>
        <p> He still wanted to get back to New York City, but Regailians see him as the "Warrior" for some reason. He later learns that there are prophecies (Predictons of what could happen) that include a person named "Warrior", and it has to be someone from the overland. So then he realizes why he is being the one that everyone is talking about. </p>

        
        <p>Because of the "Warrior" now in it's suited place, other animals (mainly the rats) in the underland are mad. The rats are mad, because they wanted to take over the underland. Later, he realized that his dad, fell into the underland around 2 years ago, and that he is currently trapped.</p>
        <p> Now, he has two ideas. He wants to escape the underland, BUT also wants to rescue his dad. He wants to save his father, so he gets other regailians </p>

        <h1 class="title">About This Book</h1>
        <p> This book, <i>Gregor and the Code of Claw</i>, is about the fifth and final prophecy, The Prophecy of Time. </p>
        <p>It starts off with Gregor getting Sandwich's sword (The sword is very valuable, but come on, he's the warrior) and gets ready to fight. </p>
        
        <p>The reason is, in the last book, <i> Gregor and the Marks of Secret</i>, some mice end up near Regailia and it starts a mission to find the cause and to resolve the issue. So Gregor and a few others including Luxa go travel to places they think there would be a reason to the issue. So they travelled very far from Regailia and went into not-as-used territory. So they then want through a lot of events including Luxa getting sick, finding Ripred trapped, travelling to the Firelands, encountering active volcanos, and finally seeing what was happening to the mice. </p>

        <p> What was happening was that they were getting lead into a pit of lava near a volcano by the rats. The rats were just leading them into a pit of lava and the mice just couldn't do anything. So, the team wanted to execute a plan to save some mice. But when they try to resuce some mice, a volcano escapes which leads them to find safe air to breathe and shelter, and eventually leave.</p>

        <p> At the end, Gregor goes through a tough decision of going back to Regailia with Boots, Temp, and Hazard (A little boy) to tell the news of the mice and let Luxa and the rest of the team find more help and find an answer. Gregor and Luxa were in a little relationship during the series (especially around now). But after a lot of arguing and persuading, Gregor accepts their decision and heads back with his small team and leaves the other group. </p>

        <p> Also, Gregor's mother was also down in Regaila. It was because in the book before <i> Gregor and the Marks of Secret</i>, Gregor's Mom got infected with a plague that was raging around at the time which lead to a mission to find a cure. The plague was very bad, so his mother had to get treated in a place where the plague is known.</p>
        
        <p> Back to this book, Gregor got Sandwich's Sword and wanted to go see some prophecies and if there were any more relating to him. In fact, there was another prophecy relating to the warrior. The prophecy was called "The Prophecy of Time", and the contents explained it clearly. It was normal until it kept saying things realting to time running out and you had to act fast. But the thing Gregor was horrified about was that it said "When the Warrior had been killed". He went through so many prophecies that could have killed him, but now it says it in the prophecy.</p>

        <p>His brain was just always on the topic of him possibly dying. With that, the prophecy also said "When the monster's blood is spilled"</p>
